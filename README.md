# Recommender-System

Within this project, I considered calculating a user's relevance in the recommender based on the
quality of suggestions received and recommendations produced by users. The database has 610
users, 193,609 objects, and 100,837 ratings, with each user rating a minimum of 20 items. The
objects are movies of 9,743 titles, and the star ratings range from 1 to 5. Various graphs of the
findings were produced by using the MovieId database.

The collaborative filtering process of the recommender system has the most effect on the outcomes
of the data retrieved. Collaborative Filtering is based on predicting a userâ€™s interest in the
preferences of a set of users who are regarded as similar to this user. Regardless of the technique
used in the CF process, the analytical goal is to reduce overfitting by increasing the recommender
accuracy; however, there are certain goals to consider, such as avoiding overspecialization
circumstances, finding useful items, and recommendation credibility, precision, and recall
measures.
The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and its associated metrics: MSE & RMSE, and normalized mean
absolute error are commonly used in similarity techniques to find the similarity given distinct users
x and y: sim(x,y) relying on their ratings of things that both users have evaluated. As can be shown,
there are no significant changes in the quality of suggestions received whether values of
k-neighborhoods are employed.
The increase in performance and results produced using the suggested technique enables the
creation and implementation that enable the monitoring and optimization of the collaborative
Filtering process of the recommender findings.
